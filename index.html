      <li> <h3> Ghanche District, Gilgit–Baltistan</h3></li>
      <p class="spot-details">Gilgit-Baltistan's Ghanche district stands almost aloof with its beautiful valleys and settlements inhabited by the most hospitable locals and river irrigated lands. The central location in the district is Khaplu, which is a beautiful landscape with high summits, flowing blue waters and waterfalls.

The people of this small settlement on the bank of River Shyok, are warm and loving, as they were centuries before.

Going a little ahead from Khaplu, the curvy road takes one to the delta of River Shyok, where it splits up, flowing through the gravel filled river plain. The peak of Mashabrum mountain can also be seen in the backdrop.</p>

      <li><h3> Rural areas near Punjab river</h3></li>
      <p class="spot-details">Punjab has been gifted with countless blessings including fertile land and lush green farms. Nature has also blessed Punjab with colors of every season, as winter ends vivid colors of spring spread around.

According to Syed Mehdi Bukhari, Sialkot, a city standing near the banks of River Chenab, is also known as the centre of artisans. Perhaps, not only the soils straddling this river, but also the people living near its banks owe their fertility to Chenab. Iqbal, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Shev Kumar Batalvi, and many other fertile minds have their roots here. The River Chenab flows from Marala, 24 kilometres from the city of Sialkot.</p>
